                    When commissioning product testing, it may be preferable to use an accredited laboratory.
                    Accredited laboratories are subject to regular and vigorous assessment by an independent agency,
                    and in the event of a court case, reports from these laboratories may carry more credibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The National Association of Testing Authorities and its international counterparts provide strict
                    independent assessments of, and accreditation for, competence in testing against specific safety
                    standards.

                    It is not compulsory for test laboratories to carry accreditation.

                    If a laboratory is accredited to test for one standard, or part of a standard,
                    it does not necessarily mean they are accredited to test for the whole standard, or a different
                    standard.

                <p>
                    It is vital to check for accreditation for the particular testing required, including all relevant
                    parts
                    of a
                    standard.

                    When checking a test laboratoryâ€™s accreditation, remember to ask:

                    <li>
                        what specific standards or parts of standards the laboratory is accredited to test for
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if the accreditation relates directly to the required testing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        for the accreditation reference number
